							A Simple Ray-Tracer

1. Goals
	A simple ray tracer that renders the cornell box from an .obj file. It only
	simulates direct, diffuse light and uses no acceleration data structure. 
	Only the diffuse color of a material is considered, if it is available in
	the .obj file. If no diffuse color is available the surface is rendered
	red. The camera position is fixed to the origin and is viewing along the 
	negative z axis.
